# GameOfLife

You will need to do a few steps before being able to run the project 
Mainly you will need to have openFrameworks downloaded

After downloading and unzipping, you will need to place it in your openFrameworks/apps/myApps folder

If you are having issues with it not connecting to openFrameworks, 
you will need to take all the contents from the inner GameOfLife folder and move it into the outer GameOfLife folder

GameOfLife/GameOfLife/All Content 
^ Move all content into this folder

Once that is done, you should be able to run the program


The controls are: 
Click a pixel to change its state
Press SPACE to run the iteration
Press C to clear the canvas
Press R to randomize the pixels
